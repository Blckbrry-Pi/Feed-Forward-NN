Ohh and He let's me be crazy about things that Im so passionate about  that most guys would laugh at and make fun of. Recycling  planting flowers and smiling at people just because I want to make their day! :] He's perfect for me. He understands me in every aspect a man could. Hes sweet enough to damper my attitude and sarcasm at times but bullheaded enough to not always give in to me. Lets me whine if I want attention and holds me more than I could ever want to be held.
